        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my space of innovation and design! I’m Gazal Valvani, a passionate student at the University of Colorado Boulder, pursuing a dual major in Mechanical Engineering and Creative Technology and Design. I thrive at the intersection of art, engineering, and technology, where creativity enhances the technical world. My love for cars, racecars, and imaginative design fuels my drive to create solutions that are both functional and visually striking.</p>
        <p>With experience as a UAV research trainee and a UI/UX designer intern, I’ve developed a unique skill set that combines technical expertise with artistic vision. I enjoy tackling engineering challenges with a creative twist, whether it's optimizing vehicle dynamics or designing intuitive user experiences. My goal is to design solutions that not only solve problems but also inspire and captivate. Let's create something extraordinary!</p>
